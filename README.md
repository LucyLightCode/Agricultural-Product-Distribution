# Agricultural-Product-Distribution

Business Overview/Problem GreenSeason Farms faces a critical business challenge related to optimizing harvest schedules and distribution. The primary issues the company encounters include:

✓ Inefficient Harvesting: The current harvesting process is primarily based on traditional seasonal patterns and historical data, resulting in inefficiencies. This approach leads to underutilization of resources during peak seasons and overproduction during off-peak times. ✓ Demand Variability: The demand for agricultural products fluctuates due to factors such as weather conditions, consumer preferences, and market trends. GreenHarvest Farms often struggles to accurately predict these variations, leading to issues with overstocking or understocking products. ✓ Shelf Life Management: Different crops have varying shelf lives, and ensuring products reach customers at their peak freshness is a challenge. Misjudging harvest times can lead to product wastage and reduced profits. ✓ Transportation Optimization: The distribution network encompasses multiple destinations across the country. Finding the optimal routes and delivery schedules to minimize transportation costs while meeting demand is a complex problem.

Aim of the Project

The objectives of the Agricultural Product Distribution Forecasting project are as follows:

✓ Develop a robust demand forecasting model that accurately predicts product demand based on historical data, weather conditions, and market trends. ✓ Identify key parameters that affect production demand.


# Model Report
ARIMA: This model performed well, particularly for Apples and Lettuce. Suggest using ARIMA for short-term forecasting of these products.

Prophet: This model offers good flexibility and handles seasonality well. Recommend using Prophet where longer-term predictions and understanding trends are important.

Random Forest: This model can provide insights into the factors driving sales. Use Random Forest to understand feature importance and potentially improve longer-term forecasting.

# Recommendations
Reduce waste: By optimizing harvest schedules and accurately predicting demand, the company aims to minimize overproduction and spoilage, leading to less waste.

Increase profits: Improved forecasting and optimized distribution can lead to better inventory management, reduced transportation costs, and potentially even premium pricing for fresh produce, ultimately boosting profitability.

Optimize harvest schedules: Aligning harvest schedules with predicted demand ensures efficient resource utilization and minimizes the risk of under- or over-harvesting.

Improve distribution: Efficient transportation routes and delivery schedules ensure timely delivery of fresh produce to customers while minimizing costs.
